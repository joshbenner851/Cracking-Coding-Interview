//Write code to partition a linked list around a value x, such that all nodes less than x come before all nodes greater than or equal to x.

//basically kinda sort a linked list



//Assumed doubly linked list w/o loop
//Moving all nodes less than x to the left of it
//Don't sort or move the one's greater than x

public static void PartitionList(Node n, int val)
{
	if(n->next = null && n->prev == null)
	{
		return; //List is length one 
	}


}



//Questions:
//Is this singly or doubly linked
//If singly, are we given access to the first node?
